00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.004
- We want you to visualize how AI

2
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:08.000
can create value for your company and your customers.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.008
Let's look at some of the concrete ways

4
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:14.002
that Google, a company all of us interact with,

5
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:19.001
uses AI to create value for its customers.

6
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.003
Even among technology giants,

7
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.002
Google stands out as the leader,

8
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.009
both in developing the AI technology,

9
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.009
as well as deploying it

10
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.004
to power the diversity of its products and services.

11
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:37.002
Of the thousand different ways that Google deploys the AI,

12
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.009
from driverless cars to advertising to YouTube,

13
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:46.000
let me high three of their latest applications.

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.005
Let's start with search, Google's oldest service.

15
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.009
Google has long deployed AI

16
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.003
to make search more relevant to users.

17
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:59.001
Examples include Voice Search,

18
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.004
which enables users to pose queries via speech,

19
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:07.000
and RankBrain, which uses neural networks

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.003
to increase the relevance of search results.

21
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.002
The latest advance is MUM,

22
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:17.007
short form Multitask Unified Model,

23
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:20.007
which was showcased in mid-2021

24
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:24.006
and represents a step improvement.

25
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:29.007
MUM aims to integrate content and context

26
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:33.005
at a level not achieved so far.

27
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.006
Let's say you want to figure out

28
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.005
which school is best for your child.

29
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:42.000
The best answer would depend on deep knowledge

30
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.004
about your child, your family,

31
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:46.009
the school options available to you,

32
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.008
and the specific characteristics of each school.

33
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:54.001
In other word, the best answer requires

34
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:59.006
a deep integration of content and context.

35
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.008
Similar to this type of question,

36
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:05.004
MUM's mission is to help people meet

37
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:09.003
many of the fuzzy and complex information needs

38
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.006
in their daily lives.

39
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.002
The fewer the number of search queries

40
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.006
a user needs to make to come up with the best answer,

41
00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:21.007
the better it is for him or her.

42
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:27.001
As another example, take Google's Pixel-branded smartphones.

43
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:32.004
In October, 2021, Google launched Pixel 6 and 6 Pro,

44
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.004
the latest models.

45
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:35.009
According to reviews,

46
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.002
these devices compete well

47
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:41.000
with the best from Apple and Samsung,

48
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.003
at significantly lower prices.

49
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.004
In some important ways,

50
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:50.003
they outdo them in terms of user benefits.

51
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.006
The differentiator in these smartphones

52
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:57.002
is the pervasive use of AI.

53
00:02:57.002 --> 00:03:01.009
Pixel 6 runs on a custom-built tensor chip

54
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:05.004
designed to run multiple machine learning models

55
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:10.004
in the device itself instead of in the cloud.

56
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:13.004
As a result, everything in the device,

57
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:16.004
from audio quality to battery usage,

58
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:20.008
becomes smarter and the apps respond faster,

59
00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:23.003
because information does not need to travel

60
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:28.003
back and forth between the device and the cloud.

61
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:31.000
A new Live Translate feature

62
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.005
enables the user to message back and forth

63
00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:37.007
with real-life simultaneous translation

64
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:41.004
without opening a separate app.

65
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:44.004
And there is software that guides cameras

66
00:03:44.004 --> 00:03:47.008
to determine the exposure and color balancing

67
00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:51.002
much more accurately than any other device,

68
00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:54.003
especially for people with darker skin,

69
00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:58.004
a first ever feature in a smartphone.

70
00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:03.002
Finally, look at Google's fora into drug discovery.

71
00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:07.007
In late 2021, Google's parent, Alphabet,

72
00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:12.004
launched a new company, Isomorphic Labs,

73
00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:16.008
charged with using AI to discover new drugs,

74
00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:21.001
Demis Hassabis, the Co-Founder and CEO of DeepMind,

75
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.003
a Google subsidiary and the company's spearhead

76
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:31.008
for AI research, will also serve as Isomorphic's CEO.

77
00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:33.008
In addition to its own research,

78
00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:39.001
Isomorphic will utilize DeepMind's AlphaFold technology,

79
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:42.003
which has already demonstrated the ability

80
00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:46.002
to predict the structure of nearly every protein

81
00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:50.009
in a human body with near perfect accuracy.

82
00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.004
Isomorphic also announced

83
00:04:53.004 --> 00:04:57.002
that while it will bring AI expertise to the table,

84
00:04:57.002 --> 00:05:01.004
it will partner with pharma and biomedical companies

85
00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:04.007
to assemble the complementary capabilities

86
00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:07.002
needed to discover new treatments

87
00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:09.007
and take them through clinical trials

88
00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:12.006
and commercialization.

89
00:05:12.006 --> 00:05:17.005
Now think about how you may be able to deploy AI

90
00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:20.000
to make your products and services

91
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.001
more tailored to each customer's specific context,

92
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:29.003
to add new and better features to them,

93
00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:34.001
and to develop entirely new products and services.
