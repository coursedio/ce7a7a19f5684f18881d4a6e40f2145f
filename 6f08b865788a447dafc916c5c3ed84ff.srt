00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.004
- Artificial intelligence is transforming every function

2
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.005
in every industry, be it agriculture, banking,

3
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.008
healthcare, or transportation.

4
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:14.000
- Here are some of the key takeaways from this course

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.009
on artificial intelligence and business strategy.

6
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.006
- AI can be defined as any computer system that mimics

7
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.008
to at least some degree natural intelligence

8
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.007
exhibited by humans and other species.

9
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:33.001
- [Left Speaker] The three major approaches to developing AI

10
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.002
are supervised learning, unsupervised learning,

11
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.009
and reinforcement learning.

12
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.008
- Data to AI is like fuel to a fire.

13
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.001
The cleaner, richer, and larger the dataset

14
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.000
on which it is trained, the more accurate

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.001
your AI model will be.

16
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.001
- For market research, AI's biggest impact

17
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.004
lies in using the power of natural language processing

18
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:05.007
and computer vision to tap into unstructured data.

19
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:10.005
- AI can help hyper-segmentation strategies where each buyer

20
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:16.009
and each user could eventually become a segment of one.

21
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.002
- AI can drive product innovation

22
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:23.000
either as an embedded feature of the end product

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.009
or as a tool to design and develop the end product.

24
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.000
- Leading-edge companies are starting to build digital twins

25
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.005
of their supply chains, deploying AI to manage

26
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.008
the digital twins and using the output

27
00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:43.002
to augment their decisions and actions.

28
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:46.001
- AI can be deployed for smarter management

29
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:51.003
of all aspects of the HR value chain: job search platforms,

30
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.004
candidate screening, training and development,

31
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:58.003
promotion decisions, even departures.

32
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:02.005
- Since we are all human, society seems willing

33
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:06.006
to accept human frailties much more readily

34
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:10.004
than errors attributable to machines.

35
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:15.002
This creates moral dilemmas regarding how to deploy AI

36
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:20.008
in contexts where it can affect life or death decisions.

37
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:24.007
- Since AI models are trained on historical data,

38
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:27.009
there is serious risk that deploying such a model

39
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:32.008
can perpetuate and even amplify past biases.

40
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:35.001
You can pursue systematic approaches

41
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.009
to mitigate these risks.

42
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:43.001
- Last but not least, AI will affect jobs in three ways.

43
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:47.008
It will augment and alter but not eliminate some jobs.

44
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:50.009
It will eliminate the need for some jobs.

45
00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:54.003
And it will create entirely new jobs,

46
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:57.005
sometimes in entirely new industries

47
00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:00.007
that did not exist before.

48
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:04.000
- We wish you success on the never-ending journey

49
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
of learning about and deploying AI.
