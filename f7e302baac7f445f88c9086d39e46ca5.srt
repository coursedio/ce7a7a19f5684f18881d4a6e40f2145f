00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:04.005
- While scientific efforts to mimic human intelligence

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.003
go back centuries,

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:10.002
the modern AI era began in the 1950s,

4
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.000
concurrent with the invention

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.009
of increasingly powerful digital computers.

6
00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.007
A 1956 workshop at Dartmouth College

7
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:23.004
is widely regarded as the seminal event

8
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:28.003
that launched systematic research in AI.

9
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.003
In the first few decades.

10
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:35.005
Symbolic AI served as the dominant paradigm in AI.

11
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:40.002
The thinking was that computers can be made intelligent

12
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.006
by first decoding the facts

13
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.002
and decision rules that experts,

14
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:49.008
such as doctors used to undertake cognitive tasks

15
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.009
and then codifying this knowledge

16
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.007
into computer programs.

17
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:58.002
Symbolic AI exhibited early promise

18
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:01.003
with small demonstration programs.

19
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:04.003
The heightened expectations led to the rise

20
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:07.000
of so-called expert systems

21
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.003
in the late 1970s and 1980s.

22
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:15.000
Reality, however, proved to fall dramatically short

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.006
of the high hopes.

24
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:20.000
The fundamental problem with symbolic AI

25
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.009
was that experts could verbalize only a small fraction

26
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.005
of the knowledge in their brains.

27
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.003
As a result, this type of AI

28
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:35.000
could never be as smart as the experts, let alone smarter.

29
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.002
The real breakthrough in AI

30
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.005
and its exploding application

31
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:45.001
in all walks of life came about in the early 2010s.

32
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.008
This is when a new band of researchers

33
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:52.006
were able to utilize the explosion in cheap computing power

34
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:57.001
and the vast availability of internet-fed data

35
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.004
to implement their ideas

36
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:03.002
regarding deep neural networks.

37
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:10.002
This new paradigm differed radically from symbolic AI.

38
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:14.007
Unlike symbolic AI's top-down approach,

39
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.006
the neural network approach aimed

40
00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:20.000
to make computers intelligent

41
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.009
by mimicking how babies learn.

42
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.005
They see adults walking and want to emulate them.

43
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:30.000
They try something and fall down.

44
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.009
They try again, perhaps a little differently.

45
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:38.008
After many tries, they learn to fall less often.

46
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:40.008
Further trial-and-error learning

47
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:46.008
eventually makes them experts at walking and running.

48
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:50.001
Could computers learn in a similar way?

49
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.000
The neural network paradigm

50
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
has proved to be hugely successful,

51
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.001
so much so that people such as Bill Gates

52
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.000
and Elon Musk have voiced alarm

53
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.006
at the risks of super intelligent AI

54
00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:09.000
one day making humans expendable.

55
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.002
While super intelligent AI

56
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.003
is probably many years away,

57
00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:16.000
it's worth looking at some of the questions

58
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.009
that AI researchers are working on today.

59
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.004
Few, short learning.

60
00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:27.002
How to train an AI on small, rather than big data?

61
00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:29.002
Transfer of learning.

62
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.009
How to enable an AI trained in one domain

63
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:37.001
to carry over the learning to another domain?

64
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.001
Accelerated learning.

65
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:43.008
How to dramatically accelerate learning by an AI.

66
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:48.006
For example, by creating its own synthetic data

67
00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:55.007
or by having a master AI and a student AI work in tandem.

68
00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:57.006
Explainable AI.

69
00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:00.003
How can we go inside the black box

70
00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:05.007
to understand the logic developed by an AI?

71
00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:07.005
Generative AI.

72
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:09.005
How to develop an AI

73
00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:14.002
that can generate truly novel output.

74
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:15.005
Multimodality.

75
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:21.001
How to enable an AI to take a diversity of data

76
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.002
such as audio, video, touch, et cetera,

77
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:27.002
simultaneously and come up

78
00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:30.009
with integrated learning?

79
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.003
Human-computer interaction.

80
00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:36.007
How to create robots

81
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:39.009
that can navigate a room full of people

82
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:46.000
and understand what is going on and be of assistance.

83
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.008
Merging of the human brain with AI.

84
00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:52.003
How to enable the human brain

85
00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:55.001
to communicate with the external world

86
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.008
without any hardware connection at all?

87
00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:02.004
Neuralink, one of Elon Musk's companies,

88
00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:06.001
is working on exactly this challenge.

89
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:08.000
Once you solve this problem,

90
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.007
a logical next step would be to merge human intelligence

91
00:05:13.007 --> 00:05:15.009
with artificial intelligence.

92
00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.007
Scary but also exciting.

93
00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:23.005
It appears likely that many, if not all

94
00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:29.003
of these questions will get answered within this decade.

95
00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:32.003
While you may not have all the answers,

96
00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:36.001
it would be useful to speculate how AI

97
00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:40.002
will affect the way tasks you're responsible for

98
00:05:40.002 --> 00:05:43.007
might be done differently five years from now

99
00:05:43.007 --> 00:05:45.009
and 10 years from now.
