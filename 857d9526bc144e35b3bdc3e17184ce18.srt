00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.001
- Three major elements

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:06.001
of any company's internal operations are designing

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.003
and building the factory or service center,

4
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:13.000
day-to-day operations and quality control.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.006
Using concrete examples from BMW, DoorDash and Landing.AI,

6
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:23.005
let's look at how these companies are deploying AI

7
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.009
across the three domains.

8
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.001
BMW is partnering with NVIDIA

9
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:34.006
to use AI for designing a new drive trained factory.

10
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:39.001
The partners have deployed NVIDIA'S Omniverse software

11
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.008
to create a digital twin of the entire factory,

12
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:47.001
enabling managers to see in photorealistic detail

13
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.005
how the factory will look and operate.

14
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.003
The virtual factory shows all machine tools and workers

15
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.004
exactly where they will be stationed.

16
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:01.004
As virtual parts move through the virtual factory,

17
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:04.002
the software even takes into account

18
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:10.001
the effects of gravity, material type and workers tools.

19
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.008
While factory builders have used simulations for many years,

20
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:20.005
today's digital twins, like BMWs, are radically different

21
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:24.008
in terms of the number of factors they incorporate.

22
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:28.007
This richness of inputs enables engineers

23
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:32.006
to simulate the actual working of the factory

24
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.009
at a level much closer to reality.

25
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.000
And many of today's AI algorithms simply did not exist,

26
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.005
even 15 years back.

27
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:48.009
As these algorithms run through millions of cycles

28
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.000
to gather training data,

29
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
they help the engineers understand what's suboptimal

30
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and how they might tweak the overall factory design.

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.003
DoorDash showcases the use of AI in day-to-day operations.

32
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.008
DoorDash is a logistics company

33
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:13.001
that enables customers to order and get goods delivered

34
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.003
from local merchants.

35
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:19.002
To use DoorDash to order from say a restaurant,

36
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:21.009
you log in and choose the restaurant.

37
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:26.000
Once you pick what you want, DoorDash shows you the bill

38
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.007
and the estimated delivery time.

39
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:31.006
You check out and wait.

40
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:35.008
How does DoorDash predict the delivery time?

41
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:39.005
The company uses a supervised learning algorithm

42
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:42.003
to train its ML model.

43
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:47.005
Historical training data include the actual delivery time,

44
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:51.004
as well as input details pertaining to each order,

45
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.008
the merchant, a timestamp, as well as details

46
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.004
pertaining to the neighborhood

47
00:02:57.004 --> 00:03:00.004
such as number of outstanding orders,

48
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:03.008
number of available couriers, day of the week,

49
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:06.008
holiday or not, et cetera.

50
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:11.009
As new data emerges, the model gets retrained regularly.

51
00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:16.000
The goal is to be accurate to the last minute.

52
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.004
Overshoot and customers may not order.

53
00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:22.008
Undershoot and they may get angry.

54
00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:26.008
Behind the scenes, AI also plays a role

55
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:29.008
in DoorDash's logistics engine,

56
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:32.007
balancing supply and demand of couriers,

57
00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:36.003
planning optimal routes with changing traffic patterns

58
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:38.007
and matching couriers to merchants

59
00:03:38.007 --> 00:03:41.002
and customers in real time,

60
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:46.000
picking the optimal solution from millions of combinations.

61
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.005
Finally, Landing.AI

62
00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:54.003
illustrates the use of AI for quality control.

63
00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:57.008
Founded by Stanford's professor Andrew Ng,

64
00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:03.001
this company helps clients manage their internal operations.

65
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:05.009
One such client is a steel company

66
00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:11.002
that must routinely test for defects in steel sheets.

67
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:13.001
Defects can be problematic

68
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:17.000
in terms of aesthetics, functionality or both.

69
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.005
However, this is not true of all defects.

70
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:25.003
So the key challenge is not merely to identify a defect

71
00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:29.008
but to figure out which is problematic and which not.

72
00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:34.002
For AI, this is a supervised learning problem.

73
00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:36.005
To train the ML model,

74
00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:40.008
Landing.AI has worked with human inspectors

75
00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:45.005
to label each type of defect as problematic or not,

76
00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:49.009
paying particular attention to accuracy and consistency

77
00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.001
across different inspectors.

78
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:57.002
Once trained, the machine learning model has proved

79
00:04:57.002 --> 00:05:01.003
to be more accurate than the human inspectors.

80
00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:06.004
For a large steel mill, even 1% greater accuracy

81
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:11.007
pays off very quickly for the investment in AI.

82
00:05:11.007 --> 00:05:14.008
Now, analyze all three aspects

83
00:05:14.008 --> 00:05:18.005
of your companies internal operations.

84
00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:22.005
Designing and building a new factory or service center,

85
00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:26.001
day-to-day operations and quality control.

86
00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:28.009
How might you apply AI

87
00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.001
to improve upon what you currently do?
