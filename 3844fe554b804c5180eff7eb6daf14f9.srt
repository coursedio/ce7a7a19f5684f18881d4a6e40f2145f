00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.003
- AI can drive product innovation

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.009
in one or both of two ways.

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.003
As an embedded feature of the end product,

4
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:16.002
or as a tool to design and develop the end product.

5
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.000
I use the generic term product to refer

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.007
to both products and services.

7
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:27.008
Let's look at AI as an embedded feature of the end product.

8
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:32.007
The starting point must always be to gain insights

9
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:37.005
into your customer's known as well as hidden needs.

10
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:42.002
Doing so often requires immersion in the customer's world,

11
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:47.000
as well as understanding the needs of their customers.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.005
Deep insights will almost always reveal

13
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.000
that some needs are being met at best partially,

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.006
and some not at all.

15
00:00:56.006 --> 00:01:01.005
The next step is to explore how one or more AI tools,

16
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:05.000
computer vision, natural language processing,

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.005
complex computational capability, or robotics,

18
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.002
can be embedded in the product

19
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:15.007
to meet these needs more completely.

20
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:21.005
As an example, take John Deere's See & Spray tractors.

21
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:25.007
In recent years, environmental sustainability

22
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:29.008
has become a growing imperative for farmers.

23
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.006
Meeting this goal requires that farmers

24
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.007
cut down on the use of chemicals.

25
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:40.004
As the world's leading agricultural machinery company,

26
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:45.002
John Deere has stepped in to help find a solution.

27
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:48.009
The company's answer, embed computer vision

28
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.006
in an attachment to its tractors.

29
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.006
As the tractor moves through a farm,

30
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:58.009
an array of high-resolution cameras

31
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.002
takes images of whatever is growing underneath.

32
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:06.008
An untrained human eye would have a tough time

33
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:10.006
distinguishing between a crop and a weed.

34
00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:16.000
However, a neural network trained through a million images,

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.003
a case of supervised learning, is able to classify

36
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:24.009
a weed from a crop, almost flawlessly.

37
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:30.003
The AI then directs automated nozzles to spray herbicides

38
00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:32.006
on just the weeds.

39
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.009
The end result for the farmer,

40
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.004
80% reduction in the use of herbicides

41
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:42.008
as well as significant cost savings.

42
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:48.001
Let's now look at AI as a tool for product development.

43
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.006
By way of example, consider the challenge

44
00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:55.007
of developing small organic molecules.

45
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:59.006
Organic chemists have historically relied

46
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:01.008
on intuition to figure out

47
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:06.001
how to synthesize a desired molecule.

48
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.001
The number of possible options,

49
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:13.005
most of which are dead ends, is simply too large

50
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:18.005
to use pure logic to find the right answer.

51
00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:23.007
Marwin Segler, a German organic chemist come AI researcher,

52
00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:28.002
decided to tackle this challenge differently.

53
00:03:28.002 --> 00:03:32.009
Segler fed the AI system almost all of the known

54
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.008
single-step organic chemistry reactions,

55
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:40.004
about 12.4 million in total.

56
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:42.007
He specified the end goal,

57
00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:47.000
a specific desired organic molecule.

58
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.003
A reinforcement learning algorithm then got to work,

59
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:54.009
using a neural network to discover a multi-step

60
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:59.008
synthesis route and the required starting reagents.

61
00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:04.007
The benefits, speed, efficiency, and cost savings.

62
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:08.007
Interestingly, now that Segler has demonstrated

63
00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:13.002
what AI can do, it has become possible for chemists

64
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.007
to invent new drug molecules

65
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.007
not previously thought possible.

66
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:22.004
The opportunities to use the AI as a tool

67
00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:27.006
for accelerating product innovation are universal.

68
00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:31.008
They include making sense of unstructured data,

69
00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:35.007
for gaining deep insights about customers' needs,

70
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:38.009
as well as exploring a much larger number

71
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.003
of possible designs to discover a short list

72
00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:45.007
of the best options.

73
00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:49.009
Now think of at least one innovation opportunity

74
00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.008
of each type within your company.

75
00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:55.004
How might you be able to embed

76
00:04:55.004 --> 00:05:00.006
some type of AI in one of your products or services

77
00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:04.000
to dramatically improve its functionality

78
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.006
for the customer, and how might you be able to use AI

79
00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:14.000
as a tool to accelerate the next product development

80
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
or redevelopment initiative?
