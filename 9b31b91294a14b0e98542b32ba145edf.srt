1
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.000
- Diversity is an innate feature

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.006
of all natural phenomena, including us humans.

3
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:12.002
We differ from each other by DNA, sex, race,

4
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:16.000
ethnicity, age, nationality,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.006
socioeconomic status, family context, friendships,

6
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:24.000
life experiences, you name it.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.001
For marketers, a direct implication of diversity

8
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:32.003
is that markets are segmented and that companies

9
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:35.007
should aim to develop tailored strategies

10
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.002
for different segments.

11
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:42.005
Marketers have long faced two major hurdles

12
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:46.001
in implementing good segmentation strategies.

13
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.009
One, lack of rich data on buyers.

14
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:54.007
Two, very high cost of customization.

15
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.009
Developments in information and production technologies

16
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:01.004
have enabled companies to overcome these hurdles

17
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:03.004
to some extent.

18
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:09.001
Today, the rise of AI is pushing the envelope much further

19
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.004
towards hyper-segmentation, whereby each buyer

20
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:18.007
and each user could eventually become a segment of one.

21
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:21.001
Let's see how.

22
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:25.004
The majority of adults now have an online presence.

23
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:30.001
While some data is private, much of it is public.

24
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.001
Also, companies always have data

25
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.001
on every customer they have interacted with.

26
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.008
Combining internal with external data

27
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:44.006
can give marketers far richer insights

28
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:49.003
into the peculiarities of every single buyer.

29
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:52.002
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms,

30
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:56.006
such as k-means clustering, can parse us through

31
00:01:56.006 --> 00:02:01.002
this large, growing and constantly changing database

32
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:06.008
more precisely than traditional statistical measures.

33
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:10.009
This is how AI-savvy banks and insurers

34
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.007
can develop a finely tailored risk profile of each customer,

35
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:19.001
even in those cases where the customer may have

36
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:22.007
no credit history and no hard assets,

37
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.009
but does have a social media presence

38
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:29.001
and a network of contacts.

39
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:32.008
This analysis can enable the bank or the insurer

40
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:36.006
to offer interest rates or insurance premium

41
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:40.007
that are more precisely and more richly informed

42
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:44.005
than those from competitors.

43
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:48.002
AI can also help develop more finely-tailored

44
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:52.006
marketing campaigns, delivering the right message

45
00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.005
to the right target audience

46
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:58.007
via the right channels at the right time.

47
00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:02.006
Each time you search for something on Google or Amazon,

48
00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:06.002
the company learns a bit more about what you want

49
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.007
right now in real time.

50
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:12.007
This data goes immediately to work,

51
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:17.000
sending you tailored messages that have proved effective

52
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.005
with people most similar to you

53
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:22.005
along a broad array of factors.

54
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:24.004
The likely outcome?

55
00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:29.003
Lower cost of customer acquisition.

56
00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:32.006
Marketers can also deploy AI's trial

57
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:35.007
and error learning approach.

58
00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:38.000
Let's say the goal is to decode

59
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.008
what combination of headline, image, copy,

60
00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:44.007
colors, and time of delivery of an ad

61
00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:49.000
would be most effective for each viewer.

62
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.005
Based on past data, the algorithm could begin

63
00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:55.005
by serving viewers different combinations

64
00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:59.000
with a high probability of success.

65
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.009
It would then learn by looking at

66
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.005
who clicks on which combination.

67
00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:07.006
Through further iterations,

68
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:10.008
it would have refined the segmentation

69
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:14.002
as well as become smarter at serving

70
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:21.006
even more customized messages and formats for each viewer.

71
00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:25.006
The root cause behind much of the waste in marketing budgets

72
00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:29.007
is knowing only partially or not at all

73
00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:33.001
what products or service a potential customer

74
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:35.006
may be ready to buy,

75
00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:38.009
or if they are already inclined to buy something,

76
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:44.000
how to upsell and what to cross-sell.

77
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.009
Deploying AI to generate deeper insights

78
00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.000
into each unique buyer and buying context

79
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.001
can significantly increase the return

80
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:59.004
on marketing expenditures.

81
00:04:59.004 --> 00:05:01.002
Building on these ideas,

82
00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:05.001
you may like to pursue three questions.

83
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:10.007
First, what data about your actual and potential customers

84
00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:14.004
do you already have within the company?

85
00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:18.002
Second, what data exists externally,

86
00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:21.003
but is currently untapped?

87
00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:27.001
Third, how might AI be deployed to parse through this data

88
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:31.009
to enable better segmentation strategies for your company?
