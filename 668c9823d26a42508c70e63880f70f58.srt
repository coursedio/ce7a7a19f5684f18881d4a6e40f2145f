00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.008
- Doing business without market research

2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:08.004
is akin to flying an airplane blind.

3
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.008
While casual market research is as old

4
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.009
as human civilization,

5
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.003
systematic market research began in the 1920s

6
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:22.006
and is now a well-developed discipline.

7
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.003
Now withstanding developments

8
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.002
over the last hundred years,

9
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.006
market research is in the early stages

10
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:34.001
of a profound AI-powered revolution.

11
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:38.006
Market research practitioners are reexamining

12
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:44.006
every aspect of how AI can help discover better answers

13
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.009
to marketing questions, such as:

14
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.004
What do your target customers

15
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:53.006
and consumers want and need, and why?

16
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.008
What are they willing to pay, and why?

17
00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:00.005
What do they expect from your products and service?

18
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.008
How do they perceive what you offer?

19
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.009
What's your brand awareness and brand image?

20
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.004
Who are your competitors?

21
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.000
Their strengths and weaknesses?

22
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.006
How are these changing?

23
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.004
AI's biggest impact lies in using the power

24
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.003
of natural language processing

25
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:26.004
and computer vision to tap into unstructured data.

26
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:30.003
Doing so can broaden the external ecosystem

27
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:32.008
that can be tapped into

28
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:37.009
and deepen the insights gathered from doing so.

29
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.005
Let me highlight four of the most important ways

30
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:44.007
AI can help you tap into unstructured data

31
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:47.001
for market research.

32
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.004
First, AI can help marketers

33
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:54.001
capture the information embedded in social media posts,

34
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.008
on platforms such as LinkedIn,

35
00:01:56.008 --> 00:02:00.007
Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, and the like.

36
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:04.009
Worldwide, every single adult younger than 40

37
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.002
already spend more than two hours

38
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:10.008
on social media every single day.

39
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:14.009
Almost all social media posts exist in a form

40
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:19.008
of free-form text, audio, images, and video.

41
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:23.006
AI can decode this unstructured data

42
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:27.008
to yield better insights about the wants, needs,

43
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:32.007
attitudes, and behaviors of target consumers.

44
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:37.006
Second, AI can unlock insights buried

45
00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:41.003
in contact center recordings.

46
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:45.006
Most companies use contact centers where customers can ask

47
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:49.004
about product, place orders, file complaints,

48
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:52.005
or seek product support.

49
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:57.001
Companies have long relied on contact center personnel

50
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:03.001
to log the call and record a few relevant details.

51
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:07.000
This practice leads to a vast under-utilization

52
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.008
of available information.

53
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:14.000
AI-powered tools for natural language understanding

54
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.007
can interpret and codify

55
00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:20.003
all of these recordings far more efficiently

56
00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:23.005
and in real time.

57
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:28.009
Third, AI can make focus groups more insightful.

58
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:33.008
Focus groups, whereby a moderator facilitates discussion

59
00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:36.008
among a select group of six to 10 people

60
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:39.000
to discuss a topic in some depths,

61
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.006
are are a staple of market research.

62
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:46.006
Typically, companies rely on their observers

63
00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:49.008
to make sense of the discussion.

64
00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:54.001
The risk is that corporate personnel can be selective

65
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.008
in what they take in

66
00:03:55.008 --> 00:04:01.001
and biased in interpreting what they do take in.

67
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:05.002
AI can potentially do a much better job

68
00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:09.007
at interpreting all of the visual and audio data

69
00:04:09.007 --> 00:04:12.002
without any bias.

70
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:16.006
Now, think about the next two market research studies

71
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:20.004
that your organization may need to launch.

72
00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:25.004
How might you deploy AI tools to enrich

73
00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:27.008
and deepen these studies?
