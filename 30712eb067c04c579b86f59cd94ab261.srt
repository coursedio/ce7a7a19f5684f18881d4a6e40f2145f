00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.000
- Opportunities to use AI

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.008
for smarter human resource management

3
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:10.001
exist in all aspects of the HR value chain,

4
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.006
job search platforms, candidate screening,

5
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:15.003
training and development,

6
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.003
promotion decisions,

7
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:20.001
even dismissal.

8
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.001
Like every technology,

9
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:27.002
AI can also be misused or abused.

10
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:30.007
People may put up with perceived unfairness

11
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.002
in many context

12
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:36.003
but if it's their livelihood,

13
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.007
and sense of self-worth

14
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:42.003
perceived unfairness can easily lead

15
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:46.003
to tearing the company in the media, lawsuits,

16
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.005
or even violence.

17
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.002
Companies need to be particularly conscious

18
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:55.001
about using AI for HR in ethical,

19
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.003
and bias-free ways.

20
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.002
Let's start with the use of AI

21
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:03.008
by job search platforms such as LinkedIn,

22
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.003
and ZipRecruiter.

23
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.009
These platforms recommend open positions

24
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.005
to individuals and candidates to companies.

25
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:16.000
Nearly always,

26
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.005
the platform needs to use natural

27
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.001
language processing to decode,

28
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.004
and individuals credentials on the one hand,

29
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:28.006
and job requirements on the other.

30
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:33.006
Consider now the use of AI to screen candidates.

31
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:38.002
Most large employers ask people to apply online.

32
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:42.004
They input always includes resume information

33
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.000
but may also include

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.007
asynchronous video interviews.

35
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:50.003
Companies can also look at the candidates

36
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:53.008
social media posts and government databases

37
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.007
such as police records.

38
00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:59.008
AI models play a crucial role

39
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:03.002
in screening this information.

40
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.007
Natural language processing technology

41
00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:09.003
is essential to decode the candidate's

42
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:12.007
application as well as text-based

43
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.004
social media postings.

44
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:16.004
In turn,

45
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:19.007
computer vision technology is essential

46
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:22.003
to interpret video interviews

47
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:27.006
as well as images and video post on social media.

48
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.004
There are no ethical issues with using AI

49
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:33.006
to decode the candidate's application,

50
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:37.007
and to assess fit with the company's needs.

51
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:38.008
It's also reasonable

52
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:42.000
for companies to analyze government databases

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.005
to assess risks of criminality or terrorism.

54
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:50.007
However, I contend that it is bad practice

55
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:54.001
to use AI to assess someone's personality

56
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.008
from video interviews.

57
00:02:56.008 --> 00:03:00.008
Personality is a complex construct.

58
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:05.002
Today's AI is too rudimentary to decode it

59
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:07.000
from video interviews,

60
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.008
and most experts view it as no better

61
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:14.002
than trying to extract oil from a snake.

62
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:17.003
Regarding analysis of social media posts,

63
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:20.000
it's a gray area.

64
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
These posts exist in the public domain,

65
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and the content can be analyzed well

66
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.005
to assess someone's interests and views,

67
00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:33.009
though not their personality.

68
00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.009
The issue is privacy.

69
00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.003
Also some governments require

70
00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.009
that asked by candidate,

71
00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:45.000
the company must be able to explain

72
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.006
specifically why he or she was rejected.

73
00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:54.001
AI is mostly a black box.

74
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:57.002
And saying that my AI did it,

75
00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.007
would not be an acceptable answer

76
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:02.002
to these governments.

77
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:06.002
How about using AI for training and development?

78
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:09.002
Translation systems developed using AI

79
00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:14.002
are already very competent across many languages.

80
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:16.004
Companies can use these systems

81
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:19.003
to translate their online training material

82
00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:21.006
into multiple languages quickly,

83
00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:24.003
and inexpensively.

84
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:26.009
AI tools can also be used

85
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.005
to assess an individual's grasp

86
00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:32.008
of specific materials accurately,

87
00:04:32.008 --> 00:04:37.002
and to suggest the next module in the program.

88
00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:38.002
As a result,

89
00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:42.007
people can learn in a more personalized manner.

90
00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:46.005
Finally, let's look at how AI is used

91
00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:49.004
to decide who to promote.

92
00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:51.008
As with screening job applicants,

93
00:04:51.008 --> 00:04:57.009
this context also has potential for misuse of AI.

94
00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.001
Documented cases exist of companies

95
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.009
or consultants training AI models

96
00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.002
on historical data pertaining

97
00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:11.004
to who was promoted in the past or not.

98
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:12.004
In the US,

99
00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:16.005
such an approach is likely to yield AI models

100
00:05:16.005 --> 00:05:20.009
that may disproportionately favor white males

101
00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.006
even when others are more qualifying.

102
00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:28.005
It is an imperative that companies be especially

103
00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:32.001
vigilant when using AI to guide them

104
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:35.008
in making promotion decisions.

105
00:05:35.008 --> 00:05:37.005
Building on these ideas,

106
00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:41.000
I propose the following assignment.

107
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.002
Pick three different HR processes

108
00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:46.002
in your company.

109
00:05:46.002 --> 00:05:50.005
How might you deploy AI to manage these processes

110
00:05:50.005 --> 00:05:52.004
more intelligently?
