1
00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.002
- According to a global survey by McKinsey,

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:09.002
55% of all companies have already adopted AI

3
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.007
in one or more functions.

4
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:18.001
I predict this number to be above 80% by 2025.

5
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.007
It's hard to imagine any job staying untouched

6
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:27.009
by the direct or indirect effects of AI.

7
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.005
This prediction applies even to jobs

8
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:34.002
such as farmers and security guards.

9
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:38.002
The farmer will spend much more time operating drones

10
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:41.003
and AI-powered farming machinery

11
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.009
than physical work in the field.

12
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.001
And computer vision and biometric entry

13
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:52.008
will eliminate the need for many security guards.

14
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:56.008
AI will affect jobs in three ways.

15
00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:03.001
One, it will augment and alter, but not eliminate some jobs.

16
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.009
Two, it will substitute for other jobs,

17
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.004
eliminating the need for them.

18
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:13.008
Three, it will create entirely new jobs,

19
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:19.008
sometimes entirely new industries that did not exist before.

20
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:22.009
This impact will be dynamic.

21
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.005
Some jobs being augmented today

22
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:30.009
may get substituted tomorrow, and we cannot fully imagine

23
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.000
what new jobs may get created five years from now.

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.001
School teachers are a good example

25
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.008
of AI's augmentation effect.

26
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:46.005
Given the cognitive and behavior complexities of this job,

27
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:51.004
it's hard to imagine AI reducing the need for teachers.

28
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:55.003
However, AI is already helping many teachers

29
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.007
become more effective.

30
00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:59.004
Take high school.

31
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.008
Rather than mark up and suggest edits

32
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.009
to every student's writing assignment,

33
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.001
an English teacher can ask them

34
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:12.006
to use AI-powered software, such as Grammarly Premium.

35
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:17.000
The software can do the markup and suggest edits.

36
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.008
The teacher can then meet with each student

37
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.008
to review his or her common mistakes

38
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:26.007
and what the grammar should be.

39
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:30.004
This way, students can learn at a faster pace

40
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:35.004
and the teacher can spend more time with each student.

41
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:39.008
Similar software is already available for other courses,

42
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.002
such as math and physics,

43
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:46.004
or to learn entirely new languages.

44
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:49.003
Other jobs that AI is augmenting,

45
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:52.004
but would not replace anytime soon,

46
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:56.002
include nurses, doctors, hair stylists,

47
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:59.008
software engineers, creative professionals,

48
00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.000
to name just a few.

49
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.002
These jobs are cognitively, behaviorally,

50
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:12.001
and/or physically too complex for today's AI.

51
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:18.002
Now, consider jobs at risk of elimination by AI.

52
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:23.000
Obvious examples include cashiers at checkout counters,

53
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
factory workers, and truck drivers.

54
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.005
In developed economies, self checkout

55
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:34.000
in grocery stores is already commonplace.

56
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.002
In factories, robots are taking over from workers.

57
00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:43.004
And autonomous cars will do away with the need for drivers

58
00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:46.003
sometime this decade.

59
00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:49.004
According to the World Economic Forum,

60
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:53.008
15% of all jobs in retailing, manufacturing,

61
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:59.004
and transportation globally are at risk of elimination.

62
00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:04.001
Business leaders should treat job elimination by AI

63
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:08.003
not merely as an opportunity to reduce costs,

64
00:04:08.003 --> 00:04:11.003
but also as an opportunity to redeploy

65
00:04:11.003 --> 00:04:16.000
the freed-up workforce towards expanding customer value.

66
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.005
For example, in retail stores, former cashiers

67
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:24.008
could be redeployed to other in-store opportunities,

68
00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:27.006
such as helping customers find products

69
00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:31.006
and even cross-selling or upselling.

70
00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:35.000
Finally, let's look at how the rise of AI

71
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.002
is likely to create entirely new jobs.

72
00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:42.009
While reducing the need for routinized jobs,

73
00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.002
AI will increase the need for jobs

74
00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:50.008
that require analyzing, planning, and deciding.

75
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:53.006
We will need fewer data entry clerks,

76
00:04:53.006 --> 00:04:57.002
but more data analysts, fewer accountants,

77
00:04:57.002 --> 00:04:59.003
but more financial advisors,

78
00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:01.003
and fewer construction workers,

79
00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:04.008
but more machinery operators.

80
00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:09.001
The World Economic Forum projects that many of the new jobs

81
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:11.005
will emerge in what the forum calls

82
00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:14.008
the care economy, the creator economy,

83
00:05:14.008 --> 00:05:17.007
and the green economy.

84
00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:21.008
Given the turbulence, as well as the opportunities ahead,

85
00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:25.002
it is imperative for governments and companies

86
00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:28.006
to increase investments in developing the skills

87
00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:33.000
and knowledge that the new jobs of tomorrow will require.
