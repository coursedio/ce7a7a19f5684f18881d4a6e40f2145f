00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.008
- I'd like to ask you a question.

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.005
Have you used AI in the last 24 hours?

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.003
If your answer is no,

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:11.006
let me ask you, if you have used face recognition

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.004
to unlock your smartphone

6
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:17.007
or interact with autocorrect or voice-to-text features?

7
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:22.004
If so, then you're already a regular AI user.

8
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.000
We may not realize it

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.009
but we are already surrounded by AI.

10
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.005
It's in our smartphones,

11
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.009
it's in YouTube's recommendation engine,

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.005
it's in Google Search.

13
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:35.000
It's in many of the driver assist features

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.005
in Tesla cars.

15
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.005
It's in many hospitals where AI is starting

16
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:43.006
to help radiologists diagnose MRI images.

17
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:45.005
It's in our policing systems

18
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.009
where facial recognition is used increasingly

19
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.005
to identify suspects.

20
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:56.003
So what exactly is artificial intelligence?

21
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:58.007
The key to answering this question lies

22
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:02.007
in first defining the term natural intelligence.

23
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:06.006
That is intelligence as exhibited by humans

24
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.009
and other artificial.

25
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.003
According to the American Psychological Association,

26
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:15.003
intelligence refers to the ability

27
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:18.004
to understand complex ideas,

28
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:21.006
to adapt effectively to the environment,

29
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:23.009
to learn from experience

30
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.005
and to engage in various forms of reasoning.

31
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.007
Using this definition as a starting point,

32
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:35.003
we can define AI as a computer system

33
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.006
that exhibits these traits

34
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:40.001
to at least some degree.

35
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:41.005
By this definition,

36
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:44.003
it's easy to conclude that a calculator

37
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:49.006
would not qualify as an example of artificial intelligence.

38
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:52.002
While it can do complex calculations,

39
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.003
it does not adapt to the environment

40
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:59.009
and it certainly does not learn from experience.

41
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.007
That said, not everybody in the AI community

42
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:07.009
dismisses the calculator as not being an example

43
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.004
of very rudimentary AI.

44
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.002
Nearly 400 years back

45
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.002
when the French mathematician Blaise Pascal

46
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:19.006
invented the first mechanical calculator,

47
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:23.007
many a journalist ascribed human-like intelligence

48
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:25.002
to this simple machine.

49
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:29.000
After all, what differentiated humans from animals

50
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.006
was that humans could calculate, animals couldn't.

51
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:36.005
So if a machine can calculate,

52
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:40.008
it must be called intelligent.

53
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:43.006
Looking back, if we now conclude

54
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:48.004
that no, a calculator is certainly not intelligent,

55
00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:51.001
it's worth noting that we humans

56
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:53.008
have long suffered from hubris.

57
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:58.005
Once a machine starts doing cognitive tasks as well

58
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:00.000
or better than humans,

59
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.003
we have a tendency to denigrate it

60
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:05.002
as merely calculative ability

61
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:09.001
not worthy of being called intelligence.

62
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:13.006
Even today, a small minority of AI scientists

63
00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:15.008
dismiss facial recognition,

64
00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:18.000
natural language understanding,

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.003
and driver assist features as not really true AI.

66
00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:25.003
To me, such values reflect,

67
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:28.000
mold the hubris of these scientists,

68
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.003
then how we should define AI.

69
00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.008
As may be obvious by now,

70
00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:39.002
AI is not a binary black-or-white concept.

71
00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:43.002
That is a computer system is either AI or not AI.

72
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:46.004
Rather, like human IQ,

73
00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:48.005
computer systems also vary

74
00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:51.007
in their degree of intelligence.

75
00:03:51.007 --> 00:03:53.006
Merely 15 years back,

76
00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:56.004
the accuracy of image recognition systems

77
00:03:56.004 --> 00:04:01.003
to classify photos that did or did not include the image

78
00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:04.002
of a cat hovered around 50%.

79
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:06.008
No better than tossing a coin.

80
00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:09.008
Today it's in the high 90s.

81
00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:12.006
Similarly, almost by the day,

82
00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:15.002
AI systems are getting smarter

83
00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:17.007
at interpreting MRI scans,

84
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:20.005
understanding and generating speech

85
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:23.005
and autonomous navigation.

86
00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:26.000
Perhaps in 10 years' time,

87
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.005
we would look back and wonder

88
00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:32.005
why we ever called present-era systems as AI,

89
00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:37.008
similar to how we view calculators today.

90
00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:43.001
Present-day AI systems are extremely domain specific.

91
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:46.000
An AI that is good at facial recognition

92
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.005
is useless at understanding speech and vice versa.

93
00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:54.000
Domain specificity also implies

94
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.008
that some types of AI are already far smarter

95
00:04:57.008 --> 00:04:59.006
than humans could ever be.

96
00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:04.006
For example, playing chess or the Chinese game of Go.

97
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:08.000
On the other hand, in most other domains,

98
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.009
humans remain much more intelligent than computer systems.

99
00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.005
The biggest difference currently

100
00:05:16.005 --> 00:05:19.005
between human and artificial intelligence

101
00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:23.001
is that human intelligence is multifaceted.

102
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:27.002
The same brain can read, write, speak,

103
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:29.002
calculate, interpret emotions

104
00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:34.002
and do 1,000 other cognitive tasks effortlessly.

105
00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:36.006
Even the best AI systems today

106
00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:41.003
reflect narrow, artificial intelligence.

107
00:05:41.003 --> 00:05:47.000
Now, think about the many aspects of your work context

108
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.009
that are already or could soon be powered by AI.
