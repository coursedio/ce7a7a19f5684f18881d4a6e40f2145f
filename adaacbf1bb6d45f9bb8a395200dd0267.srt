1
00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.000
- Supply chains of tomorrow must be designed

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.005
to respond to much greater uncertainty

3
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.008
than was true even 10 years back.

4
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.007
The numerous factors buffeting supply chains

5
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:18.004
include pandemics, demand volatility,

6
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:22.003
raw material disruptions, labor shortages,

7
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:26.004
geopolitical tensions, cyber attacks, terrorism

8
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.006
and more frequent extreme weather patterns.

9
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:34.007
As a result, in designing and managing supply chains,

10
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:36.009
the ability to recover quickly

11
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.002
from unexpected developments

12
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:45.001
has become as important as maximizing efficiency.

13
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.003
Every supply chain is a network of organizations.

14
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:53.007
Think about raw material mines, factories,

15
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:58.002
trucks, ships, trains, ports, warehouses.

16
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:02.001
All parts of a complex network.

17
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.005
How does one ensure that such a network

18
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.006
can be not only efficient

19
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:11.008
but also resilience and responsive?

20
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.006
The answer lies in ensuring

21
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:19.004
that the network exhibits the following properties.

22
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:23.006
One, end-to-end visibility.

23
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.003
Like control towers,

24
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:29.008
network managers must maximize visibility

25
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.009
into every node and every link,

26
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.005
as well as the external factors

27
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.006
that may cause turbulence

28
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:40.008
in these nodes and links.

29
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:45.004
Visibility helps ensure that unexpected changes anywhere

30
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:49.002
in the system get anticipated, recognized,

31
00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:54.002
and if needed, acted upon with minimum delay.

32
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:57.004
Two, agility.

33
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:00.001
When unexpected changes do occur,

34
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.003
network managers must be able

35
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:04.007
to figure out the best response

36
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:08.001
and act on it rapidly.

37
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.008
To create such a network,

38
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:12.001
leading edges companies are starting

39
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:16.003
to build digital twins of their supply networks,

40
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:19.006
deploying AI to manage the digital twins

41
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:26.001
and using the output to augment their decisions and actions.

42
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.006
A digital twin refers to a simulation

43
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:32.006
of the physical network in a computer,

44
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:37.001
creating a replica that mirrors real-world objects

45
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:40.003
and the links between them.

46
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:42.005
The digital twin integrates

47
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:45.002
the company's internal private data,

48
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:49.007
including LT sensors with external public data,

49
00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:51.009
such as satellite images,

50
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.009
weather predictions and political developments.

51
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:59.006
Let's say you have a supplier in Wenzhou, China.

52
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:03.008
The digital twin can automatically incorporate the risk

53
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:05.007
of an incoming hurricane,

54
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:08.009
something that will be hard of people to do

55
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.009
when dealing with dozens or even hundreds

56
00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.002
of nodes and links.

57
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:18.008
In this manner, a digital twin can anticipate problems

58
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:21.000
before that happen.

59
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.007
It can also use AI to recommend

60
00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:29.002
or even execute the optimal solution.

61
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:33.004
While simulating reality is not a new idea,

62
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:37.003
the value of AI models lies in their ability

63
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:40.005
to decipher nonlinear interactions

64
00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:42.002
among very large

65
00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:45.004
and constantly changing sets of data,

66
00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:48.009
both structured and unstructured.

67
00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.009
Similar to interactive games,

68
00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.009
such as chess and Go,

69
00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.004
reinforcement learning algorithms

70
00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:58.007
train company-specific AI models

71
00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:02.000
by playing millions of what-if games

72
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.004
on the multidimensional board of a digital twin.

73
00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:09.005
Once the model has mastered

74
00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:11.008
a particular supply chain network,

75
00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:16.006
it springs into action when needed.

76
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.005
Let's say there's an accident

77
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:21.006
at a parts supplier in Malaysia.

78
00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:24.005
The AI would not only alert you

79
00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:26.009
but also suggest actions,

80
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.008
such as placing an immediate order

81
00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:32.000
with a distributor in California

82
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.008
who happens to have inventory in stock.

83
00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:40.007
AI models can deal with such complexity far better

84
00:04:40.007 --> 00:04:44.008
than even the smartest supply chain managers.

85
00:04:44.008 --> 00:04:49.006
They also keep retraining constantly.

86
00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:51.005
Companies such as Amazon

87
00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:54.002
have been using the digital twin concept

88
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:58.004
to manage their supply chains for some time.

89
00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:02.008
Now tech providers, such as Google and NVIDIA

90
00:05:02.008 --> 00:05:08.006
have started offering these capabilities to other companies.

91
00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:10.004
Building on these ideas,

92
00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:15.006
you may want to analyze your company's supply chain as well.

93
00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:18.002
Who should be the members of a team

94
00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:21.003
to assess how to build a digital twin

95
00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:23.007
for your supply chain?

96
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:27.003
How many tiers upstream could you go

97
00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:31.009
in building an excellent mirror of the physical reality?
